# Output Directory

This directory contains generated output files from the example scripts.

These files should not be included in the Git repository due to their potential size and because they may contain personal data.
When you run the example scripts, outputs will be generated and stored here.

Example outputs include:
- CSV files with extracted data 
- PNG files with visualizations 

## Privacy Note
All output files containing personal health data should remain private and are automatically excluded by the `.gitignore` file. Do not commit any personal health data to public repositories.
